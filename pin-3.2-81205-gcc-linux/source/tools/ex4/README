1. Defining BBLs - We used the edges from the profile
file in order to mark off the basic blocks.
Since we have ignored indirect branches for the
purpose of profiling, we acknowledge that the BBLs are
not perfect, as they are determined only by direct branches.
2. Ranking BBLs - We traverse over the edges' targets in order
to rank the BBLs. For each BBL we hit, we accumulate the count
to the BBL's rank, then we check whether it contains a branch,
if it does not - we propogate the count to the next BBL(s).
3. We assume the hottest routine is also valid for translation,
i.e., it is found in the main image.
