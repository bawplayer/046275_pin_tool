# need to list to entry-points
# after unconditional jump, you cannot assume there's another instruction
# Remove\add unconditional jumps if needed (XED_INST1())
# Edit short jumps to long jumps if needed (XED_ENCODE())
# Indirect jumps shouldn't be touched, as they return back to the original code.
# Currently we don't count how many times an edge was NOT taken
